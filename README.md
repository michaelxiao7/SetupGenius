# SetupGenius
The best Credit Card setup calculator!

Hello! This is a simple calculator that I created to help people decide what cards might be the best fit for them! Feel free to clone this project and change the numbers to your liking

How to use:
1) Update "info.txt" to fit your setup's needs
    a) "Spending" is how much you spend on each category every year
    b) "Credits" is how much of each credit you can comfortably use up every year
      (ex. I spend exactly 200 on Uber every year, so I only value Uber at 200 since anything more than that is "wasted")
    c) "Modifiers" are variables that affect your setup
2) Hit ">Run" at the top of the file

(Note: "Travel" is general travel that includes flights, public transit, rideshare, cruises etc.)

Edge cases not handled:
1) Online Retail and Amazon are deducted separetely

Bugs:
(for the first time ever, none!)

User Stories:
Short Term:
1) Sorting the table at the end by spend
2) Ticketing system
3) Caleb Hammer meme (if you're dining out and your interest is >0, tell them they're not a CC user and link his channel)

Long Term:
3) Live logging/ticketing system
