# SetupGenius

Hello! This is an advanced credit card calculator that will generate you the most optimal card setup to fit your personal needs, using some of the most popular cards on the market
Feel free to clone this project and change the numbers to your liking

**How to use:**
1. Extract this project folder
2. Update "info.txt" to fit your setup's needs
   - "Spending" is how much you spend on each category every year
   - "Credits" is how much of each credit you can comfortably use up every year *(ex. I spend exactly 200 on Uber every year, so I only value Uber at 200 since anything more than that is "wasted")*
   - "Modifiers" are variables that affect your setup
3. Run "main.py"

**Edge cases not handled:**
1) Online Retail and Amazon are accounted for separetely
2) Streaming and Disney+ are accounted for separately
(the best workaround atm is to not include Amazon/Disney+ in your Online Retail/Streaming total)

**Bugs:**
*(for the first time ever, none!)*

**User Stories:**
*Short Term:*
*(for the first time ever, none!)*

*Long Term:*
1) Live logging/ticketing system
2) New cards to consider
